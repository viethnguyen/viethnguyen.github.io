abstract = {Driver assistance and vehicular automation would greatly benefit from uninterrupted lane-level vehicle positioning, especially in challenging environments like metropolitan cities. In this paper, we explore whether the WiFi Fine Time Measurement (FTM) protocol, with its robust, accurate ranging capability, can complement current GPS and odometry systems to achieve lane-level positioning in urban canyons. We introduce Wi-Go, a system that simultaneously tracks vehicles and maps WiFi access point positions by coherently fusing WiFi FTMs, GPS, and vehicle odometry information together. Wi-Go also adaptively controls the FTM messaging rate from clients to prevent high bandwidth usage and congestion, while maximizing the tracking accuracy. Wi-Go achieves lane-level vehicle positioning (1.3 m median and 2.9 m 90-percentile error), an order of magnitude improvement over vehicle built-in GPS, through vehicle experiments in the urban canyons of Manhattan, New York City, as well as in suburban areas (0.8 m median and 3.2 m 90-percentile error).},

abstract = {Head-mounted devices (HMD) for Augmented Reality (AR) are gaining traction thanks to a growing number of applications in the areas of image guided therapy, computer aided design, cargo packing, manufacturing and digital field service. However, providing an always available, intuitive and user friendly input for these devices remains a challenging problem. This paper explores recognizing dynamic, micro finger gestures using capacitive coupling for interacting with a head-mounted device. Electrodes are attached to fingertips of users gloves and capacitive coupling among all pairs of electrodes is measured quickly to infer the real-time spatial relationship between fingers. The system is able to recognize fine, low-effort finger gestures, such as swiping, sliding, tap, double-tap. We evaluated our prototype with 14 gestures executed by 10 subjects and found a 97% accuracy of gesture recognition.},

abstract = {Academic and industry research has argued for supporting WiFi time-of-flight measurements to improve WiFi localization. The IEEE 802.11-2016 now includes a Fine Time Measurement (FTM) protocol for WiFi ranging, and several WiFi chipsets offer hardware support albeit without fully functional open software. This paper introduces an open platform for experimenting with fine time measurements and a general, repeatable, and accurate measurement framework for evaluating time-based ranging systems. We analyze the key factors and parameters that affect the ranging performance and revisit standard error correction techniques for WiFi time-based ranging system. The results confirm that meter-level ranging accuracy is possible as promised, but the measurements also show that this can only be consistently achieved in low-multipath environments such as open outdoor spaces or with denser access point deployments to enable ranging at or above 80 MHz bandwidth.},

abstract = {The growing number of devices we interact with require a convenient yet secure solution for user identification, authorization and authentication. Current approaches are cumbersome, susceptible to eavesdropping and relay attacks, or energy inefficient. In this paper, we propose a body-guided communication mechanism to secure every touch when users interact with a variety of devices and objects. The method is implemented in a hardware token worn on user's body, for example in the form of a wristband, which interacts with a receiver embedded inside the touched device through a body-guided channel established when the user touches the device. Experiments show low-power (uJ/bit) operation while achieving superior resilience to attacks, with the received signal at the intended receiver through the body channel being at least 20dB higher than that of an adversary in cm range.},
