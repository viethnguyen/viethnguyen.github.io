Embedded screen–camera communication techniques encode information in screen imagery that can be decoded with a camera receiver yet remains unobtrusive to the human observer. We study the design space for flicker-free embedded screen–camera communication. In particular, we identify an orthogonal dimension to prior work: spatial content-adaptive encoding, and observe that it is essential to combine multiple dimensions to achieve both high capacity and minimal flicker. From these insights, in TextureCode, we develop content-adaptive encoding techniques that exploit visual features such as edges and texture to unobtrusively communicate information. TextureCode is able to achieve an average goodput of about 22 kbps, significantly outperforming existing work while remaining flicker-free.
