The growing number of devices we interact with require a convenient yet secure solution for user identi!cation, authorization and authentication. Current approaches are cumbersome, susceptible to eavesdropping and relay attacks, or energy ineffcient. In this paper, we propose a body-guided communication mechanism to secure every touch when users interact with a variety of devices and objects. The method is implemented in a hardware token worn on user’s body, for example in the form of a wristband, which interacts with a receiver embedded inside the touched device through a bodyguided channel established when the user touches the device. Experiments show low-power (µJ/bit) operation while achieving superior resilience to attacks, with the received signal at the intended receiver through the body channel being at least 20dB higher than that of an adversary in cm range.
