Hi, I am a **Senior Research Engineer** in the **Standards and Mobility Innovation Lab** at [Samsung Research America](https://www.sra.samsung.com). I work on the development of **Localization** and **Wireless Sensing** applications in mobile devices using next generation wireless technologies. My recent contributions are to the commercialization of UWB technology in Samsung hardware products. 

I received my Ph.D. from the [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering](http://www.ece.rutgers.edu/) at [Rutgers University](http://www.rutgers.edu/) in 2019. I was a member of [WINLAB](http://www.winlab.rutgers.edu/) and worked with [Prof. Marco Gruteser](http://www.winlab.rutgers.edu/~gruteser/). 

**Research Interests**:

- Mobile Computing  
- Applied Digital Signal Processing 
- UWB 
- Communication and Sensing techniques using Visible Light and Capacitive Coupling
